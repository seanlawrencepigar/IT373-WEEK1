# Reflection – Week 1

## Challenges and Solutions

### Setting Up the Virtual Environment  
Getting the virtual environment up and running was my first big challenge. I ran into permission errors and wasn’t sure how to properly activate and deactivate it at first. After trying a few times and paying close attention to the error messages, I figured out how important it is to run commands from the right folder with the right permissions. This helped me get more comfortable with the command line and gave me a good start in managing project dependencies.

### Understanding Template Inheritance  
Next, I dove into Django’s template inheritance. At first, it was confusing to see how `base.html` connected with other templates. I made mistakes with file paths and block names, which caused errors. But after some practice, I realized template inheritance is a great way to avoid repeating code and keep things organized. It also showed me how important it is to be consistent with naming and folder structure.

### Figuring Out URL Routing  
The last challenge was URL routing. I kept mixing up how to import views — sometimes using relative imports like `from . import views`, other times using app-specific imports like `from core import views`. These little details led to errors that took some time to fix. But working through them helped me understand how Django finds modules and how to properly organize the `urls.py` file. It also reminded me that being precise is key when working with frameworks.

## Overall Reflection  
This first week taught me that every error is really just a chance to learn something new. Even though some moments were frustrating, figuring out the solutions helped me build better problem-solving skills. I’m feeling more confident now navigating Django’s setup, template system, and URL routing — which feels like a solid foundation for what’s coming next.
